# set Add
method is used with sets to add a single element.
# set clear
method in Python is used to remove all elements from a collection like a set, list, or dictionary.

# set copy
 method is used to create a shallow copy of a collection like a list, set, or dictionary.
 # set differnce
is used with sets to find items that are in one set but not in another.
# set diffrence update
removes all elements from the original set that are also in other_set.

It modifies the original set directly and returns None.
# set discard
 is used with sets to remove an element — but safely, without raising an error if the element is not found.
 # set intersection
 method (or & operator) returns a new set containing elements that are common to all sets involved.
 # set intersection update
 method to update a set with the intersection of itself and another set (or multiple sets). This method modifies the original set in place.
# set is disjoint
checks whether two sets have no elements in common
# set issubset
 is another handy method when working with sets. It checks whether all elements of one set are contained in another set.
# set_isupperset
checks if a set contains all elements of another set.
# set pop 
 removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.
 # set remove
 fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"}

# Pop an element
Removes a specific element from the set.
# set symetric difference
is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both.

# set symetric diffrence update
is a set operation that updates a set by removing elements found in another set and adding elements that are not found in the original set. Essentially, it modifies the set to keep only elements that are unique to each set (i.e., not shared).
# set union
The set union operation in Python combines all elements from two (or more) sets, removing any duplicates. It's one of the most basic and useful set operations.
# set update
is used to add elements from another iterable (like a set, list, or tuple) to the original set. It’s like a union operation that modifies the original set in place.
